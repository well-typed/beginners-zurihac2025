# Beginners Track, ZuriHac 2025

## The high-level plan

Day 1:

- defining datatypes and functions
- pattern matching
- understanding inferred types
- some higher-order functions

Day 2:

- IO
- libraries

This will *not* be an exhaustive introduction,
there's unfortunately not enough time.

## More materials

There is a full introduction course to Haskell by me
available online:

- https://well-typed.com/intro
- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD8gywOEY4HauPWPfH0pJPIYUWqi0Gg10

Has videos, self-test questions, slide sets, and additional
small prorgramming exercises.

There are other good options, more than I can list,
for example:

- https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html
- Graham Hutton's book "Programming in Haskell", https://people.cs.nott.ac.uk/pszgmh/pih.html
- Rebecca Skinner's book "Effective Haskell", https://www.pragprog.com/titles/rshaskell/effective-haskell/
